# unit-4-game

the home page shows 4 crystals and a number labelled "Target"

The player must deteemine, by clicking and noticing the change in his or her "Current score", how many points clicking each crystal is worth, and then attempt to score exactly the target number by clicking crystals in the correct combination.

If the player does this, he or she wins. If he or she goes over the Target score, they LOSE.
